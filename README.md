# Art Exchange Marketplace

The art market is currently exclusive and lucrative, benefiting only a select group of wealthy individuals. This project aims to transform the art market,
making it accessible to a wider audience. It involves developing an art exchange marketplace where artists can showcase their work, and anyone can
participate by purchasing shares represented by NFTs. This approach aims to create value for both artists and individuals interested in art as an 
investment opportunity.

# Project Overview

This project is the development of an art exchange marketplace using Django, Python, HTML, and Java. The current framework includes models for artwork, NFTs, users,
preferences, and filters. Key functionalities implemented include posting artwork for sale, a bidding system, and a search algorithm for posted work.
Data is available for NFTs and candlestick chart displays.

Planned future features include Twilio verification, blockchain integration for security, and improving the user interface.

# Feedback and Collaboration

As this project evolves, I am eagerly seeking feedback and collaboration from anyone who can help propel this idea forward.

Feel free to reach out with suggestions, ideas, or collaboration opportunities!
